# Introduction

Hi everyone! I'm Abhilipsa, a 3rd year Computer Science undergraduate, currently exploring new and emerging technologies, understanding how to implement them in order to solve real-world issues, and be a part of a global community.

## Diving into my wrecked reading habit

Although, I have developed the habit of writing long-form content, I have never been fond of reading long form contents or pieces such as articles and essays unless they happen to have an **invigorating** **and** **captivating** **factor** that unravels itself few lines into the piece and keeps the readers engrossed (especially on their toes) throughout. On top of that, anything that I usually come across as a "News Piece" seems abhorrent and boring to me.

As a developer with miniscule attention span, it sometimes becomes particularly tedious for me to properly read the entire documentation of a new technology, let alone keeping touch with comprehensive Tech News (a strong and especially repulsive emphasis on "News").

But on one fine day, while I was reading about GitHub Co-Pilot, I stumbled upon DevBytes, an ultimate solution that worked for me (and might do for you too, in case you see yourself somewhere in the below venn diagram):

# The era of short-form content: From Snapchat to TikTok to DevBytes

Watching every other social media app follow the footsteps of Snapchat and TikTok on introducing the feature of sharing short and crisp content (through Snaps, Stories, Reels, Statuses, Notes, Moments, Shorts and what not), while recently witnessing Spotify hop on the trend as well, I feel DevBytes stands out from rest of the Tech News app, possessing quite a lot of features. I have listed some of them below.

### Customising one's own experience with persona/alter-ego, then signing up and saving the customisation:

You can experience a smooth onboarding by setting your own persona that seems fitting to the type of content you would want to see on your feed. Other than that, you can also select topics of your choice.

You can also save your customisation by signing up with your Google or Twitter account. You can then proceed to watch your bite-sized shorts by swiping down (and not up as conventionally done on other social media apps).

### Autoswipe

You can enable or disable Autoswipe in the dashboard. This lets you experience the time-bound auto rolling feature present in WhatsApp Status, Instagram Stories, Snapchat Stories, and more.

### View Hiring Opportunities (Job board) and Code Snippet

You can view Hiring Opportunities (Job board) for the day and apply to them.

Certain articles or shorts come with code snippet for reference, that you can click to view in entirety.

### Dashboard with several features:

When you click on the top left icon, you get access to your dashboard containing various features:

Feedback is also appreciated by the developers, so you can rate your experience and tell them what bugs you faced, what features you liked, disliked or want to be added in near future.

# Conclusion

DevBytes has been developed by a team of experienced developers who are passionate about staying on top of the latest trends and developments in the industry, providing developers with (cherry-picked by experts) short, bite-sized news updates (within 64 words) on topics related to coding, programming, and other related fields, without sacrificing the quality of the content.

The app covers a wide range of topics, including updates on programming languages, software frameworks, operating systems, and more. This means that developers can stay informed about the latest developments in their area of expertise, as well as broaden their knowledge by exploring topics outside of their usual focus.

# Chrome Extension: The Fun doesn't end on the phone

The best part is that you don't have to miss out on all the fun if you're not on your phone all the time, and rather stuck to your PC or Laptop. The fun comes bundled in a Chrome Extension with many other features!

However, I personally prefer to use DevBytes App on the phone, since it is more accessible: I can use it anywhere and anytime I'm taking my time off from the larger devices.
